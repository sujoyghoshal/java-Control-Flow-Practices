## **Practice Problems and Solutions**

| **Level**  | **Practice Problem**  | **File Name**  | **Description**  |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Level 1**  | Compute Grade Based on Marks | `ComputeGrade.java`  | Takes marks of three subjects, calculates average percentage, assigns a grade, and provides remarks based on predefined criteria. |
| **Level 1**  | BMI Calculation  | `CalculateBMI.java`  | Computes the Body Mass Index (BMI) using weight and height, then classifies the person as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese. |
| **Level 1**  | Find Day of the Week | `DayOfWeek.java` | Determines the day of the week for a given date using Zeller's Congruence formula. |
| **Level 2**  | Leap Year Program (if-else)  | `LeapYearIfElse.java` | Checks whether a given year is a leap year using multiple `if-else` conditions. |
| **Level 2**  | Leap Year Program (Logical Operators)  | `LeapYearLogical.java`  | Optimized version of Leap Year check using a single `if` condition with `&&` and `||` operators. |
| **Level 2**  | Prime Number Check  | `PrimeNumber.java`  | Determines if a number is prime by checking divisibility from `2` to `n-1`. |
| **Level 2**  | Armstrong Number Check | `ArmstrongNumber.java`  | Verifies if a number is an Armstrong number by summing the cube of its digits. |
| **Level 2**  | Count Digits in a Number  | `CountDigits.java` | Counts the number of digits in a given integer using a loop. |
| **Level 3**  | Harshad Number Check | `HarshadNumber.java`  | Checks whether a number is a Harshad number by verifying divisibility with the sum of its digits. |
| **Level 3**  | Abundant Number Check | `AbundantNumber.java`  | Determines whether a number is an Abundant Number by comparing the sum of divisors with the number itself. |
| **Level 3**  | Simple Calculator using Switch  | `Calculator.java`  | Implements a basic calculator supporting `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operations using a `switch` statement. |
